# Hydrodinamics-Methane

Anaerobic digestion is a biological process, bound to the biokinetics concepts. 
Efforts have been made in order to improve the biogas productivity focusing in improve the energy conversion of the microbes. 
In addition, is possible to improve the energy productivity by reducing the parasitic energy load. 
Mixing is generally cited as the largest contributor to the parasitic energy load of the power consumption. 
In order to reduce the parasitic load mixing energy input must be reduced. 
To reduce mixer load, it is necessary to understand the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic state of the substrate that is being mixed in the anaerobic digester.  
To better understand the biological and physical interaction of mixing, a series of experiments has been designed to evaluation traditional and innovative mixing approaches.  
The experiments aim to collect and compare the digestion performance and the hydrodynamics data of traditional pump mix systems and the PWM400Â® mixer develop by PAX Water Technologies, this unit is low electricity input mixer. 
In order to obtain a novel evaluation of the system, three different tracer mixing experiments were performed to obtain a mix of results: Lilly impeller in water, Lilly impeller in manure, centrifugal pump in manure. The mixing systems were introduced in a reactor built and instrumented to obtain hydrodynamics data as same as take samples for biological samples. 
The anaerobic digester used in the experiments was a 20 m3, cylindrical vessel, thermally insulated and instrumented specifically for this studies. Variables like electrical conductivity, 
temperature, and electrical current consumption were monitored.
